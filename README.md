# Things to try
Just a list of things I need to do some experiment with.

## Benchmark redis vs SQL key-store alternatives
I'm used to use SQL Server for most things and Redis when I need to store some key-value data. It works fine for most stuff but I was wondering if it's possible to ditch Redis and make it with one less dependency. I saw that Postgres has both so it'd be nice to test this solution. It's a little bit different than SQL Server but it should work just fine for the usual stuff.

## Recreating some MassTransit feature
Specifically the routing slip and saga are the most interesting ones for me.
